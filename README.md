# video-db

End goal:
Manage a list of video urls (CRUD). Each video has a title, a URL, and a set of tags. Videos can be filtered by their titles and tags.
Tags can be added and removed to videos.

Uses SQLite tables for data storage. After basic database manipulation is complete, an interface will be built (probably using PyQt5).

Additionally:
* Can save multiple database files, allowing for different collections of videos.
* Clickable links to open videos in browser.
